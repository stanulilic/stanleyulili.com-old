## Introduction

Chart.js is a popular open-source library for visualizing data. It allows you to create different types of charts from datasets such as bar charts, pie, line, donut, scatters, and many more.

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to draw charts with Chart.js and how to customize them to suit our needs.

When you're done with the tutorial, you will learn how to create charts like the ones below:

![bar chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart-styled.jpg)

![pie chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/pie-chart.jpg)

![line chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/line-chart.jpg)

## Prerequisites

For you to understand this tutorial, you need to know the following:

- Basic understanding of Html and CSS
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript(OOP, Arrays)

## Step 1 - Installation

Before we begin using Chart.js, we need to install it first. You can install Chart.js in a couple of ways.

- Approach 1: Using a CDN

This is the fastest and easiest way to include Chart.js in your project, and it is what we are going to use in this tutorial. Make sure you grab the latest CDN link from [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js). Copy the URL that has `Chart.min.js` at the end.

At the time of this writing, the latest version is 2.8, so I will use the following link in this tutorial:

```
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.8.0/Chart.min.js
```


- Approach 2: Using NPM

You can also install Chart.js by using NPM 

Copy and paste the command below to download it in your project:

```
npm install chart.js --save
```

- Approach 3: Download from Github

Another way to include Chart.Js is to download the latest version from Github.

You can follow the link to download it: https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/latest


There are still other ways to install Chart.js, we not going to cover them all but you can visit [this link](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/installation.html) to learn more about installing Chart.js.

Now that we have learned how to install Chart.js, let's add it to our project.

## Step 2 - Setup Project with Chart.js
You can set up your project on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or you can use a text editor like VSCode or Atom or anything you like.

We are going to create a basic `index.html` file and then load the CDN into the `body` section. We will also create the `script.js` file, which will later add the code to create the charts with Chart.js. 

You can download the [starter files](https://github.com/stanulilic/starter-files-chartjs/archive/master.zip) to use them with the tutorial.

It contains only three files: `index.html`, `main.css` and `script.js`.

The `script.js` and `main.css` are empty, the `index.html` file contains the following code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
 <title>Chart.js tutorial</title>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
 
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.8.0/Chart.min.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now that we have included Chart.js in our project, lets now proceed to create a place to render the charts first.


## Step 3 - Create a Canvas to render the charts
Chart.js requires the presence of the Html5 Canvas tag which it uses to draw the charts. The canvas is used to draw lines, circles, etc. You can learn more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

Create the `canvas` tag inside the `body` tag:

```html
<canvas id="myChart" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
```
The ID is very important, and you can name it anything you like but it is recommended to use a descriptive name representing the kind of charts you want to render.

My body tag, now looks like this:
```html
<body>
<canvas id="myChart" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
 
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.8.0/Chart.min.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>

```
## Step 3 - Prepare the data 

I currently have the following table which contains popular Javascript frameworks based on the number of stars they have on Github:


| Name of JavaScript Framework | Github Stars |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| React | 136,850 |
| Angular | 52,122 |
| Vue | 148,825 |
| Hyperapp | 16,939 |
| Omi | 9,763 |


We are going to represent the data in a bar chart. The x-axis(horizontal) will be used to plot the Javascript frameworks as labels while the y-axis(cross axis) will be used to plot the number of Github stars each framework has.

We need to store the data in arrays. We are going to store the names of the frameworks in a `frameworks` variable and store the Github stars in a `stars` variable.

So open the `script.js` file and type the following code:

```javascript
var stars = [135850, 52122, 148825, 16939, 9763];
var frameworks = ['React', 'Angular', 'Vue', 'Hyperapp', 'Omi'];
```

As you can see, each framework in the `frameworks` variable corresponds with the number of Github stars it has on the `stars` variable. This is crucial to plotting accurate charts.


## Step 4 - Create a bar Chart
Write the following code at the top of the `script.js` file:
```javascript
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');
```
The code grabs the canvas element from html using the ID `myChart` and store it in a variable `ctx`.

You can name the variable anything you want,`ctx` is just a convection most programmers like to use, and it's what we will be using.


Now, let's create a chart. To create a chart, we first need to create an instance of the `Chart()`.

To create an instance, you need to call the `new Chart()`, so type the following code:

```javascript
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {}
 }
)
```

The `new Chart()` object takes the following arguments:
- `ctx` which is the variable used for storing the canvas element.
- **configuration object** which allows you specify the chart type, data and chart options.

The configuration object looks like this:

```javascript
{
 type: 'bar',
 data: {},
 options: {} // this is optional
}
```

The following is an explanation of the properties:

- `type: 'bar'`: allows you to specify the chart you want to create. In our case, we are creating a bar chart. If you wanted a pie, or line chart, you could specify it as `type: 'pie'` or `type: 'line'`.

- `data`: It contains the data(labels, datasets) that will be used to plot the charts. Don't worry about this, we will get to it shortly.

- `options`: it contains configuration options to customize the charts such as changing the position of legend, enable/disable responsiveness, control styling, etc.



Our code does not render the charts yet, for us to render the charts, We need to pass our data(the ones we stored in the variables `frameworks` and `stars`) in the data object like this:

```javascript
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
 type: 'bar',
 data: {
    labels: frameworks,
    datasets: [{
        label: 'Popular JavaScript Frameworks',
        data: stars
        }]
 },
});
```

By the way, here is how my whole `script.js` file is looking at this stage: 
```javascript
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');

var stars = [135850, 52122, 148825, 16939, 9763];
var frameworks = ['React', 'Angular', 'Vue', 'Hyperapp', 'Omi'];

var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
 type: 'bar',
 data: {
    labels: frameworks,
    datasets: [{
        label: 'Github Stars',
        data: stars
    }]
 },
})
```
Open your `index.html` file with your favorite browser, and you should now see a beautiful bar chart.

![bar chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart.png)

You can checkout the codepen demo below:
<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Stanleyu" data-slug-hash="xxxKbMQ" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="bar chart">

</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


### Understanding the Data Property

Let me now explain what happened here:
```javascript
 data: {
    labels: frameworks,
    datasets: [{
        label: 'Github Stars',
        data: stars
    }]
 },
```

The data property object has two properties `labels` and `datasets`.

The `labels` takes an array(frameworks) and displays every element as a label on the x-axis.

![bar chart labels](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart-labels.jpg)

The `datasets` takes an array of objects which has the following properties:
 - label 
 - data

`label` property, takes a string. It is usually displayed on top of the chart or when hovering the bars.

![bar chart label](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart-label.jpg)


 `data` takes an array of values(Github stars) and displays the data on the y-axis(vertically).

![bar chart data](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart-data.jpg)

## Step 5 - Control Chart.js width and height
Before we proceed to style the bars, there is an issue we need to fix. This will apply mostly to those who are testing the code in the browser to see their charts.

You might notice that the browser is displaying the chart full screen, and it is not respecting the width and height we set on the canvas element previously.

```html
<canvas id="myChart" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
```

to fix this we will need to add configurations to our bar chart instance by passing it an `options`  object and then set `maintainAspectRation` to false.

```javascript
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
    ......
    },
    options: {
        maintainAspectRatio: false
    }
})
```
If you try it again in the browser, you will see that the bar chart is 400 pixels tall(height) but the width is being ignored.

To completely gain control of the width, we need to set responsive to false.

```javascript
 .........
 options: {
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    responsive: false
 }
```

If you run the browser now, you will see that the width is 800px and the height is 400px.

![bar chart resized](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/chart-resized.jpg)


You can also check out a working Codepen here: [https://codepen.io/pen/](https://codepen.io/pen/)


Another option to **controlling the width and height of your chart is by using css**. But this option requires extra markup in HTML, but it is flexible as our chart will have controlled width and height, and it will still be responsive.

First off, you have to remove the options object:
```javascript
 ....
 // remove the following code
 options: {
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    responsive: false
 }
```

Now, let's edit the `index.html` file and put our canvas tag inside a div element.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
 <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>
```

I have removed the width and height since we don't need them anymore.

Let us now open the `main.css` and type following code:

```css
.wrapper {
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

Now, open your `index.html` file in your favorite browser and you will see it has a maximum width of 800px, and it is also responsive.

Now that we have gotten this out the way, let us now proceed to style the charts.

**Note**: In the next steps, the charts will be full screen because I want them to display properly when embedded on this page.
{: .notice--info} 

## Step 6 - Style the Chart

Let us now make our bar chart pleasing to the eye by styling it. The default styles are too boring for my taste.

Let's style the bar chart to make it look more appealing.

We will use the following properties:
 - `backgroundColor` - Takes an array of Hexadecimal or RGBA color values(strings) which will be used to color the bars in the chart.
 - `borderColor` - It takes an array of color values strings, the same as the backgroundColor property. It will color the borders of the bars.
 - `borderWidth` - It takes an Integer or a float value and it specifies how wide a border should be.

To understand the properties clearly, we will add them one by one so that you understand how and when to use them.

**backgroundColor**

Let us now color our bars by adding the backgroundColor with an array containing RGBA color values into the object in datasets property:

```javascript
 ....
 data: stars,
 backgroundColor: [
 "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)",
 "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)",
 "rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)",
 "rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)",
 "rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)"
 ]
 ....
```

**info**: I have taken the color values from the Chart.js documentation.
{: .notice--info} 

You can see the working demo in the codepen:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="Stanleyu" data-slug-hash="XWWrbNo" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="bar chart - styled">
 <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu/pen/XWWrbNo">
 bar chart - styled</a> by Stanley Ulili (<a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu">@Stanleyu</a>)
 on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


Our bar chart is looking good, but we can do better, let us add borders to make it pop.

**borderColor**

To create borders for our bar chart, we will be using the `borderColor` property by passing it an array of 5 RGBA color values. We add it after the `backgroundColor` property.

For the borderColor property to work. You must also put add the `borderWidth`, otherwise, you won't see any borders.

```javascript
 ....
 borderColor: [
 "rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)",
 "rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)",
 "rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)",
 "rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)",
 "rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)",
 ],
 borderWidth: 1
 ....

```
You should now see a beautiful bar chart with borders

![bar chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/bar-chart-styled.jpg)


<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="Stanleyu" data-slug-hash="MWWWWxY" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="bar chart with borders">
 <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu/pen/MWWWWxY">

 on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


Now we have successfully created our bar chart, let's turn into a pie chart in the next step.

## Step 7 - Create a Pie Chart
Creating a pie chart is very simple, all we need to do is to change the type from `type: "bar"` to `type: "pie"`:
```javascript
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
 type: "pie",
 ....
```
![pie chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/pie-chart.jpg)

Check out the Codepen below and see our beautiful pie chart.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="Stanleyu" data-slug-hash="mddddYK" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="pie chart">
 <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu/pen/mddddYK">
 pie chart</a> by Stanley Ulili (<a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu">@Stanleyu</a>)
 on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


Hover on the pie sections to see the label and the values.

As you can see, most properties that we used to create the bar chart, also works with creating a pie chart.

In the next step, we will turn our pie chart into a line chart.

## Step 8 - Create a Line Chart

Turning a chart from a pie chart or a bar chart into a line chart is not very hard.

There are only a few things we need to be aware of to successfully do it:

- `backgroundColor` is used to color the line points. We will just pass one color value, instead of passing on an array of values to style the points because we want the points to have the same color.
- `borderColor` is used to color the line.

```javascript
...
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
 type: "line",
 data: {
    labels: frameworks,
    datasets: [
    {
        label: "Github Stars",
        data: stars,
        backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)",
        borderColor: "rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)",
        borderWidth: 1
    }
    ]
 }
});

```

Here is how our line chart looks:


![line chart](/assets/images/posts/2019-10-05-beginner-guide-to-chartjs/line-chart-filled.jpg)


You can checkout the pen below:
<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Stanleyu" data-slug-hash="JjjjoPJ" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="JjjjoPJ">
 <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu/pen/JjjjoPJ">
 JjjjoPJ</a> by Stanley Ulili (<a href="https://codepen.io/Stanleyu">@Stanleyu</a>)
 on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


While the line chart looks good, I believe there are a few things we can change, we will remove the fill underneath the line and reduce the line curvature.

To achieve that, we will use the following properties:

- `fill` is used to specify whether the area underneath the line should be filled. If the property is not included, the line will have a fill by default. To remove the filling, you use `fill: false` property.

- `lineIntensity` is used to increase or decrease the line curvature, to remove the line curvature, set `lineintensity` to zero.

Type the following code after the `borderWidth` property:

```
...
 fill: false,
 lineTension: 0
...
```
