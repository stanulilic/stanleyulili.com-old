title: "2020 Year in Review"
excerpt: I have been reading year in review posts lately, they have inspired me to start a habit of documenting my annual progress.

I have been reading year in review posts lately, they have inspired me to start a habit of documenting my annual progress. I had a lot of goals for 2020, sadly I failed to achieve most of them. But still, there are some that I have achieved that are worth sharing, and of course, It's also worth sharing my failures. Hopefully, in a few years, I will look back at this post and see how far I have come.

## Blogging

This year didn't work out the way I hoped it would concerning my blog. I wanted to become a more consistent blogger but I failed at it. The last time I published a blog post was on May 11, 2020. The article burned me out and I lost interest in writing. I also struggled with perfection paralysis. There are so many articles I wanted to publish, some are still in drafts and others are yet to be written.

So in 2020, I wrote only 5 articles before May.

- [How to Install Nodejs and npm on Mac or Linux ](https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/how-to-install-node-and-npm-on-mac-or-linux/)
- [How to Install Nodejs and Npm on Windows ](https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-windows/)
- [Node.js Modules: Import and use Functions from Another File](https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/node-modules-import-and-use-functions-from-another-file/)
- [Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks in JavaScript](https://www.stanleyulili.com/javascript/asynchronous-programming-with-callbacks-in-javascript/)
- [Global Objects in Node.js ](https://www.stanleyulili.com/node/global-objects-in-nodejs/)

Despite the few articles, my blog grew unexpectedly, which surprised me. I have always been under the impression that Google gives more traffic to frequently updated blogs, so I was surprised to see my daily page views growing steadly long after I took a break from blogging. My blog is peaking at 400 - 700 daily page views.

### Blog statistics

This year I got 159, 047 page views and roughly 120,000 users.

The spike in May is when my [blog post](https://www.stanleyulili.com/javascript/asynchronous-programming-with-callbacks-in-javascript/) trended on Reddit.

## Freelancing

This year was a good year for freelancing. My first time experience with freelancing was in 2019 where I got one client from the UK and made only 8 dollars for a small gig, LOL. I was happy though, I did not have any freelancing experience. Fast-forward to 2020, I have managed to work with clients from countries such as the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Uganda, and South Africa. The gigs ranged from small to big.

It's been an awesome experience working with people from different countries, not only has it helped to pay for my bills but freelancing has offered me challenges I wouldn't have encountered on my personal projects. I have been working outside my comfort zone most of the time, and this has helped me improve my skills remarkably.

Most of my freelancing involves Django, setting up and managing servers.

## Personal Projects

This year I worked on a few personal projects. I wanted to create 10 big projects, but I ended up building three(small). Two are close to finishing, one is still in the works. Freelancing took a lot of my time or maybe I was just being lazy or I should blame it on 2020.

I made 175 contributions on Github. Who knows, maybe it would have been more if my freelance contributions were added to my profile.

![Github contributions](/assets/images/posts/2020-12-31-year-in-review/github-contribs.png)

- [Markdown Editor](https://stanulilic.github.io/markdown-editor/)- this was my first React project, inspired by [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app).

- [Covid API](https://github.com/stanulilic/mwcovid-api) - I made a covid API using Node(Express.js). The data is for Malawi only.

## What I Have Learned This Year

For a long time, I have always been fascinated by Node and React. This year I decided to allocate the time to learn them. Apart from the two, I also learned more Python thanks to freelancing. So here is what I have learned this year.

- Learned how to create an API with Node.js(Express.js)

- Set up web servers for WordPress, Django, and Node
- Migrate WordPress websites from shared hosting to a VPS
- Send Emails to Gmail using Django
- Upgrade Ubuntu 14 to Ubuntu 20(it was painful, LOL)
- Write text on images using Python

There are so many things I have learned this year and would need a separate blog post to cover them.
